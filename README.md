# CssPortfolio

# description
For this project I created a new site as a portfolio.  I set up different section in "about me" "work history" and "contact info."  I created a nav bar that had link that are all linked to the sections of the page.  I created an image link that takes you to previous work that has been done. I also set up an email link, a link to my linkedin, and a link to my twitter account.  I set up margins, paddings, and borders.
