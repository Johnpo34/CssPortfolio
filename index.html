                <p class="info">
                    Born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA in 1992. I am currently a student at University of Penn LBS.
                    Some of my hobbies include watching sports, golfing, and woodworking. Some of my favorite sports
                    team include the Steelers, Penguins, Pirates, Notre Dame Fighting Irish. After high school I
                    attended Clarion Univeristy on a partial football scholarship. I have spent 14 years working in the restaurant business starting at local bar and grille called
                    Damon's. I started as a dishwasher when I was 16 years old while going to school and playing sports
                    full time. Over the next three years I worked my way up from dishwasher to kitchen manager. I then
                    moved onto another local restaurant called Primantis as a cook. Over the next few months I worked my
                    way up to Front of hosue manager. I then moved onto another local restaurant called Mike & Tony's
                    Gyros as a server. Over the next year I was then promoted to fornt of the house manager. After three
                    years at that specific location, I was tasked with opening a new location of theirs as full General
                    Manager. All while working in the restuarant I held a few side jobs in construction and catering.</p>
